# Threshold ECDSA signatures

This library is a fork of ZenGo-X's [multi-party-ecdsa](https://github.com/ZenGo-X/multi-party-ecdsa) implementation of Gennaro-Goldfeder's [threshold ECDSA](https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/540.pdf) algorithm.

While `multi-party-ecdsa` has been audited, the audit was performed prior to the threshold signature implementation.

Minor changes have also been made to the API of the original code.

**No audit** has been performed on this fork.

**WARNING** this library is pre-alpha release cryptographic software. Please use caution for real-world, production use-cases.
